## Purpose

A little blog I'm running on Jekyll and Github pages. Wanted to try something that aligns to JAMstack principles; I noticed that Github pages uses Jekyll in the background, and hey, if it's good enough for Github, it's good enough for me.

**Note**: The source for this site was not created to be a template or theme, but for my own use. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want, but this code was not written with the intention of being cloned and deployed. As such, I do not provide support or guidance for doing that. I recommend reading [the official Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) to get started and [Michael Currin's' rather useful repository](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-actions-quickstart) for using Github actions for CI.
