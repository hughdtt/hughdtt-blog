## Purpose

Hugh's personal website running on Jekyll and Github pages.

**Note**: The source for this site was not created to be a template or theme, but for my own use. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want, but this code was not written with the intention of being cloned and deployed. As such, I do not provide support or guidance for doing that. I recommend reading [the official Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) and [Michael Currin's' rather useful repository](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-actions-quickstart) to get you started.
