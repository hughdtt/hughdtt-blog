WIP

## Init
Hey everyone, 

Happy to update that I've just wrapped up a project that I've been working on called Poke-Profiles! I've spent a decent amount of time out of work hours and into the night to stitch it together. I'm actually really proud of the result. It's possibly the best thing I've been able to produce on my own. You'll be able to have a look at it [here](https://github.com/hughdtt/poke-profiles). 

I'm trying to remember exactly what kickstarted the sudden surge of motivation to start a project and then try to get it completed. Anyway, somehow while browsing the internet I stumbled upon [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/2859891--025-Pikachu/attachments/2859891?mode=media). My first immediate thought was 'this is f*ckn epic'. The second thought was 'wait at minute, I remember coming across a PokeAPI library a while ago. Shouldn't I be able to make this?'. That was at the beginning of the month(ish). Anyway, here we are.
